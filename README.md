# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

This is a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The application emphasizes the use of dynamic HTML and Javascript to generate quiz questions. It further uses JavaScript to check if answers are correct and record a score. 

Finally, with the user's permission the application will use client side storage to keep track of high scores on the user's computer.

The application can be viewed here: https://mdurst365.github.io/Coding_Quiz/
